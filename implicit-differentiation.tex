\section*{Implicit Differentiation}

Suppose that a curve is defined by an equation
\[F(x, y) = 0.\]
Assuming that $y = f(x)$ is a differentiable function, we can find an expression for the derivative.

\textbf{Example.} Find the derivative $dy/dx$ if $x^2 + y^2 = 7$.

We differentiate both sides of the equation and get
\[2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0.\]
Hence
\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-x}{y}.\]
