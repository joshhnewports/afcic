\section*{Implicit Differentiation}

Suppose that a curve is defined by an equation
\[F(x, y) = 0.\]
Assuming that $y = f(x)$ is a differentiable function, we can find an expression for the derivative.

\textbf{Example.} Find the derivative $dy/dx$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ if $x^2 + xy = 2$.

We differentiate both sides of the equation. The right-hand side is $0$ and the left-hand side is
\[\frac{d}{dx} (x^2 + xy) = \frac{d(x^2)}{dx} + \frac{d(xy)}{dx}.\]
The left term is $2x$ and by the product rule we have
\[2x + x \frac{dy}{dx} + y \frac{dx}{dx} = 2x + x \frac{dy}{dx} + y.\]
Now we find $dy/dx$ in terms of $x$ and $y$, which is
\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-y - 2x}{x},\]
and we are done.
