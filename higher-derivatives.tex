\section*{Higher Derivatives}

Given a differentiable function $f$ defined on an interval, its derivative $f^\prime$ is also a function on this
interval. If it turns out to be also differentiable, then its derivative is called the \textbf{second derivative}
of $f$ and is denoted by $f^{\prime\prime}(x)$. We write
\[f^{(n)}\]
to denote the $n$-th derivative of $f$. Thus $f^{\prime\prime}$ is also written $f^{(2)}$. To refer to the variable
$x$, we also write
\[f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{d^nf}{dx^n}.\]
