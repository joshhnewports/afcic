\textbf{Definition.} A function is said to be \textbf{continuous at a point $x$} if and only if
\[\lim_{h\to0} f(x + h) = f(x).\]
A function is said to be \textbf{continuous} if it is continuous at every point of its domain of definition.

\begin{center}
\textit{Let $f$ be a function having a derivative $f^\prime(x)$ at $x$. Then $f$ is continuous at $x$.}
\end{center}

\textit{Remarks on the proof.}
We note that if a function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x$, then it is continuous at every point of its domain of
definition.
The proposition statement states that $f$ has a derivative $f^\prime(x)$ at $x$, this is equivalent to saying that
$f$ is differentiable. So what we wish to prove is:

\begin{center}
\textit{Let $f$ be a function that is differentiable. Then $f$ is continuous.}
\end{center}

We set the Newton quotient of $f$ equal to itself then multiply by $h$ and get
\[h \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} = f(x + h) - f(x).\]
As $h$ approaches 0, the left term approaches $0f^\prime$. Thus we have
\[\lim_{h\to0} f(x + h) - f(x) = 0f^\prime(x) = 0.\]
This is another way of stating that
\[\lim_{h\to0} f(x + h) = f(x).\]
By definition, $f$ is continuous.
