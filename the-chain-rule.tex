\section*{The Chain Rule}

\textbf{Chain rule.} \textit{Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions having derivatives, and such that $f$ is defined
  at all numbers which are values of $g$. Then the composite function $f \circ g$ has a derivative, given by
  the formula}
  \[(f \circ g)^\prime(x) = f^\prime(g(x))g^\prime(x).\]

  \textit{Remarks on the proof.} For $h$ in $H_1$, we find
  \[f^\prime(u)g^\prime(x).\]
