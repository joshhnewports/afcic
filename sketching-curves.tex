\textbf{Example.} Find the limit of
\[\frac{2x^3 - x}{x^4 - 1}\]
as $x$ becomes large positive or negative.

Let $Q(x) = (2x^3 - x)/(x^4 - 1)$. To take the limit of $Q(x)$ as $x$ becomes large, we factor the largest power of $x$ from both the numerator and denominator. This is
\[\frac{x^3(2 - 1/x^2)}{x^4(1 - 1/x^4)}.\]
Cancelling yields
\[\frac{1}{x} \frac{2 - 1/x^2}{1 - 1/x^4}.\]
Finding limits of $Q(x)$ amounts to finding limits of this expression. As $x$ goes to infinity, the right factor approaches $2$. The other factor approaches $0$. Hence
\[\lim_{x\to\inf} Q(x) = 0.\]
Furthermore
\[\lim_{x\to\pm\inf} Q(x) = 0.\]

We shall assume the upcoming expressions are functions $Q(x)$.

\textbf{Example.} Find the limit of
\[\frac{\sin x}{x}\]
as $x$ becomes large positive or negative.

Write
\[\sin x \frac{1}{x}.\]
The factor $1/x$ approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches infinity, and $\sin x$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ no matter how large $x$ is. Hence
\[\lim_{x\to\pm\inf} Q(x) = 0.\]

\textbf{Example.} Find the limit of
\[\cos x \frac{1}{x}\]
as $x$ becomes large positive or negative.

Write
\[\cos x \frac{1}{x}.\]
It is clear that $\cos x$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$. But $1/x$ approaches $0$ as $x$ goes to infinity. Hence
\[\lim_{x\to\pm\inf} Q(x) = 0.\]

\textbf{Example.} Find the limit of
\[\frac{\sin 4x}{x^3}\]
as $x$ becomes large positive or negative.

Write
\[\sin 4x \frac{1}{x^3}.\]
The expression $1/x^3$ tends to $0$ as $x$ approaches infinity. Hence
\[\lim_{x\to\pm\inf} Q(x) = 0.\]

\textbf{Example.} Find the limit of
\[x^3 - x + 1\]
as $x$ becomes large positive or negative.

Write
\[x^3(1 - \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^3}.\]
The expression $1 - 1/x^2 + 1/x^3$ approaches $1$ as $x$ becomes large. We see that
\[\lim_{x\to\inf} Q(x) = \inf\: \text{and}\: \lim_{x\to-\inf} Q(x) = -\inf.\]
